Hi Veerendra, I have made some progress, new goal is
 
implement pydantic classes
Validate the LLM output against pydantic classes
Make the given csv into chunks
we then give each chunk into the llm
add up all the chunks to form final json
right now, I'm able to give each chunk into the llm, but I'm getting errors validating output aganist pydantic class when given chunks to llms. So please continue the work from there.
